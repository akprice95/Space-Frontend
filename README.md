# Space Application Frontend

To start the GraphQL server then follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/juliannehalversen/Space-GraphQL-Server). Otherwise, you will still have access to the REST server and CRUD functionality.

## How to use

### 1. Clone project to desired location

```
git clone https://github.com/juliannehalversen/Space-Frontend.git
```

### 2. Install project dependencies

```
cd Space-Frontend
npm install
yarn serve
```

### 3. Open project in browser

[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/#/)

### 4. Experiment with my NodeJs REST API and my GraphQL API!
